## Purpose
Music@ connects users to their followed spotify artists.  A spotify player is embedded so that the user can load and play all of their artists as well as search for new music.  This app also connects user's followed artists to the bandsintown api so that they can see each artist's tour schedule.  A link to the bandsintown website is provided for each tour date so that users can easily purchase tickets.
